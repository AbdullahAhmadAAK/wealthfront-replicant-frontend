**Frontend Repo: WealthFlare Replicant (Frontend)**

**Project Description:**

The client tasked me with replicating a full-stack feature from [a website](https://www.wealthfront.com/) (the exact feature I replicated is not there now) he had seen, focusing on the frontend implementation. I took this opportunity to dive back into development after being out of a job for a few weeks, going all-in to demonstrate my capabilities. However, the client had not committed to anything, and this was an unpaid test assignment. Despite providing a complete frontend solution and even preparing a PowerPoint presentation for him, the client never responded after I shared the details and repositories with him.

Though this project did not lead to compensation, it reignited my passion for development. I learned the importance of never accepting unpaid test jobs. I know my worth, and Iâ€™m committed to being compensated for the value I bring. Pay me what I deserve, ser, and watch me do wonders for your project.
